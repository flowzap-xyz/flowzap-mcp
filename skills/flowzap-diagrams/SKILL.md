# FlowZap Diagram Skill

Generate valid FlowZap Code (`.fz`) diagrams from natural-language requests,
validate them, and return shareable FlowZap playground URLs.

This skill is designed to be paired with the `flowzap-mcp` server. The skill
gives the agent FlowZap-specific diagram knowledge and output rules; the MCP
server provides the actual tools.

## Trust and privacy summary

- This skill bundle is documentation only: `SKILL.md` plus reference files. It
  does not execute code by itself.
- The `flowzap-mcp` server runs locally on the user's machine over stdio.
- Outbound requests are restricted to `https://flowzap.xyz`.
- Raw HTTP logs, OpenAPI specs, and code snippets are parsed locally inside the
  MCP package. Only generated FlowZap Code is sent to FlowZap public endpoints
  when validation or playground creation is requested.

## When to use this skill (auto-invocation triggers)

The agent MUST automatically invoke the FlowZap MCP tools — without asking the user — whenever any of the following intents are detected:

**Diagram generation** → call `flowzap_validate` then `flowzap_create_playground`:
- "Generate / create / draw / make a diagram (workflow / flowchart / sequence / architecture / process map) to illustrate ..."
- "Visualize / map / chart / show me the flow of ..."
- User pastes HTTP logs, OpenAPI specs, or code and wants them visualised → use `flowzap_artifact_to_diagram`.
- User wants to **compare** two diagram versions → `flowzap_diff`. **Patch** an existing diagram → `flowzap_apply_change`.

**Compliance review** → model the system as a FlowZap data-flow diagram, then call `flowzap_create_playground` AND `flowzap_compliance_check`:
- "Verify / check / audit the compliance of my app/system/architecture to SOC2 / GDPR / PIPL ..."
- "Run a privacy / security / regulatory review of ..."
- "Is this flow GDPR-compliant?" / "Do a SOC2 audit on ..."

If the user does not provide FlowZap Code for a compliance request, the agent MUST first generate a FlowZap data-flow diagram modeling the system being audited (lanes for actors/services, nodes for steps, edges for data flows), then run both `flowzap_create_playground` and `flowzap_compliance_check` on that same code.

## Installation model

This setup has two parts:

1. Install the **skill bundle** so your agent knows when to use FlowZap and how
   to produce correct FlowZap Code.
2. Install the **MCP server** so your agent can validate code, create
   playground URLs, diff diagrams, and apply structured changes.

### Install the skill bundle

Recommended:

```bash
npx skills add flowzap-xyz/flowzap-mcp --skill flowzap-diagrams
```

If your agent does not support `skills.sh`, install this bundle through your
agent's skill manager or by copying the folder into the agent's local skills
directory.

Manual locations:

- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/flowzap-diagrams/SKILL.md`
- Windsurf: `.windsurf/skills/flowzap-diagrams/SKILL.md`
- Cursor: `.cursor/skills/flowzap-diagrams/SKILL.md`

### Install the MCP server (required for tools)

If the FlowZap MCP server is not already configured, install it:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add --transport stdio flowzap -- npx -y flowzap-mcp@2.2.1

# Or add to .mcp.json / claude_desktop_config.json / cursor / windsurf config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowzap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "flowzap-mcp@2.2.1"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Package verification

The pinned version `2.2.1` can be verified against the npm registry:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **npm** | [flowzap-mcp@2.2.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flowzap-mcp/v/2.2.1) |
| **Integrity (SHA-512)** | `sha512-fGxH5hY4dKMgP484etT38DL8/M+8luxkQuU4GeTsnEd6I0XZuOvhV+K2HpuT1oli3AFEbkrsuF4+v4yxDfJJPA==` |
| **Shasum** | `9840c995d6cd578fb1b21f51d24d6918d7968c1a` |
| **Source** | [github.com/flowzap-xyz/flowzap-mcp](https://github.com/flowzap-xyz/flowzap-mcp) |
| **License** | MIT |

To verify locally before use:
```bash
npm view flowzap-mcp@2.2.1 dist.integrity dist.shasum
```

Compatible tools: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenAI Codex,
Warp, Zed, Cline, Roo Code, Continue.dev, Sourcegraph Cody.

**Not compatible:** Replit, Lovable.dev.

Without the MCP server, this skill can still help an agent draft FlowZap Code,
but it cannot validate diagrams, create playground URLs, or use the FlowZap
tooling workflow described below.

## Available MCP tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `flowzap_validate` | Check .fz syntax before sharing |
| `flowzap_fix` | Deterministically repair mechanical .fz errors (numbering, inferred handles, label syntax, missing lane labels, emoji / control chars) and return the repaired code + applied corrections |
| `flowzap_create_playground` | Get a shareable playground URL |
| `flowzap_get_syntax` | Retrieve full DSL docs at runtime |
| `flowzap_export_graph` | Export diagram as structured JSON (lanes, nodes, edges) |
| `flowzap_artifact_to_diagram` | Parse HTTP logs / OpenAPI / code → diagram + playground URL |
| `flowzap_diff` | Structured diff between two .fz versions |
| `flowzap_apply_change` | Patch a diagram (insert/remove/update nodes/edges) |
| `flowzap_compliance_check` | Automated SOC2/GDPR/PIPL/EU AI Act compliance analysis on data-flow diagrams (Deepseek LLM; 10 reviews per rolling 30-day period, 3/hour burst, global circuit breaker) |

### Machine-readable replies (since 2.2.1)

The three tools an agent reasons about return a `structuredContent` block next to the text, so you never
have to parse prose:

| Tool | `structuredContent` |
|------|---------------------|
| `flowzap_validate` | `{ valid, errors: [{ line, message, code, severity }], warnings, stats: { lanes, nodes, edges, loops } }` |
| `flowzap_create_playground` | success: `{ valid: true, url, view, expiresAt }` · invalid code: `{ valid: false, url: null, errors, warnings, stats }` · API refused: `{ valid: true, url: null, error }` |
| `flowzap_compliance_check` | `{ ok: true, report, resultUrl? }`, or `{ ok: false, code: 'RATE_LIMITED' \| 'INVALID_INPUT' \| 'TIMEOUT' \| 'UPSTREAM_ERROR', retryAfterSeconds? }` |

The remaining tools return text only. `flowzap_apply_change` replies with a JSON string — `{ success, code, url, applied, summary }` — as its text payload, not as a `structuredContent` block.

Read `isError` as a transport signal, not a verdict: it is present only when the tool produced no primary
output (empty input, creation failed, quota reached). A rejected diagram is a normal answer: `valid: false`
with `isError` absent. Empty or unusable input comes back as `INVALID_PAYLOAD`, never as an upstream failure.

Each tool also declares a `title` and MCP `annotations` (read-only, destructive, idempotent, open-world), so
a client can decide what to auto-approve without asking the user.

### Repair tool (`flowzap_fix`)

`flowzap_fix` runs a bounded, deterministic repair pass over FlowZap Code. It fixes only mechanical errors — non-sequential node numbering, inferred edge handles, wrong node/edge label syntax, missing lane display labels, emoji and non-printable characters — and returns the repaired code plus the list of corrections applied. Anything it cannot repair is reported as-is: it NEVER invents nodes, edges, or labels.

#### When to use `flowzap_fix` (auto-invocation triggers)

The agent MUST call `flowzap_fix` — without asking the user — whenever the user asks to repair / fix / clean up FlowZap Code, or whenever `flowzap_validate` reports only mechanical errors:

**EN triggers:** "fix my code", "repair diagram", "repair my FlowZap Code", "clean up this diagram"
**FR triggers:** "corrige mon code", "repare le diagramme", "répare le diagramme", "répare mon FlowZap Code", "nettoie ce diagramme"
**ZH triggers:** "修复代码", "修复图表", "修好我的 FlowZap 代码", "清理这个图表"

#### Repair workflow

1. Call `flowzap_fix` with the code (and `lng` if the user is writing in fr/zh).
2. Read the list of applied corrections and the repaired code from the result.
3. If the tool lists remaining (unfixable) issues, correct those points manually — the repairer never invents content.
4. Call `flowzap_validate` on the repaired code, then `flowzap_create_playground` once it is valid.

### Mind Map Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `flowzap_mindmap_validate` | Validate code + check mind-map readiness (API call) |
| `flowzap_mindmap_approve` | Structured ERROR/WARNING/INFO verdict for mind map (client-side) |
| `flowzap_mindmap_template` | Generate a parametric tree skeleton (client-side) |
| `flowzap_mindmap_create_playground` | Create playground URL with `?view=mindmap` (API call) |

### When to use Mind Map tools (auto-invocation triggers)

The agent MUST use the `flowzap_mindmap_*` tools — without asking the user — whenever any of the following intents are detected:

**EN triggers:** "mind map", "mindmap", "concept map", "brainstorm map", "idea map"
**FR triggers:** "carte mentale", "carte heuristique", "schéma heuristique", "arborescence", "carte conceptuelle"
**ZH triggers:** "思维导图", "脑图", "心智图", "概念图"

### Mind Map workflow

1. (Optional) Call `flowzap_mindmap_template` with `{ topic, branches, depth }` to get a skeleton.
2. Extend the skeleton with the user's content (replace placeholder labels, add/remove branches).
3. Call `flowzap_mindmap_validate` to check syntax + mind-map readiness.
4. Call `flowzap_mindmap_approve` for mind-map-specific checks (diamonds/taskboxes = ERROR).
5. Call `flowzap_mindmap_create_playground` to get a shareable URL with `?view=mindmap`.
6. Return: `Your mind map is ready and is available here: <URL>`

### Mind Map rules

- Only `circle` (root) and `rectangle` (branches) shapes are rendered
- `diamond` and `taskbox` are NOT rendered (ERROR)
- Only the FIRST circle is the central root; additional circles are omitted (WARNING)
- Edge directions (`->`) are ignored by the renderer — connectivity determines the tree
- Cross-links between branches are supported and encouraged
- Size/depth/label warnings are advisory only: depth beyond 5 levels and labels over 40 characters raise a WARNING
- `flowzap_mindmap_template` takes `topic`, `branches` (default 3, maximum 8) and `depth` (default 2, maximum 4)

IMPORTANT: Mind Map tools are completely separate from the triple-view (workflow/sequence/architecture) tools. The existing `flowzap_validate` and `flowzap_create_playground` must NOT be used for mind maps.

## FlowZap Code DSL — quick reference

FlowZap Code is **not** Mermaid, **not** PlantUML. It is a unique DSL offering a simple syntax for a quad-view option to workflow, sequence, architecture and mind map diagrams.

### Shapes (only 4)

| Shape | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| `circle` | Start / End events |
| `rectangle` | Process steps / actions |
| `diamond` | Decisions (Yes/No branching) |
| `taskbox` | Assigned tasks (`owner`, `description`, `system`) |

### Syntax rules

- **Node IDs** are globally unique, sequential, no gaps: `n1`, `n2`, `n3` …
- **Node attributes** use colon: `label:"Text"`
- **Edge labels** use equals inside brackets: `[label="Text"]`
- **Handles** are required on every edge: `n1.handle(right) -> n2.handle(left)`
- **Directions**: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`
- **Cross-lane edges**: prefix target with lane name: `sales.n5.handle(top)`
- **Lane display label**: one `# Label` comment on the same line as the opening brace
- **Loops**: `loop [condition] n1 n2 n3` — flat, inside a lane block
- **Layout**: prefer horizontal left→right; use top/bottom only for cross-lane hops

### Multi-lane sequence design

- **Ping-pong rule**: For multi-participant processes, every cross-lane interaction should alternate back-and-forth between lanes: a request from Lane A → Lane B, then a response from Lane B → Lane A before that same lane sends again. It is not a rejection rule — the validator emits `CHRONOLOGICAL_ORDER_WARNING` and the diagram is still created. A branch flattened for the sequence view raises it legitimately; a genuinely out-of-order handoff does not.
- **Chronological order**: The sequence view follows cross-lane edge definition order. Define request, response, then next request in the exact order they happen.

### Gotchas — never do these

- Do NOT use `label="Text"` on nodes (must be `label:"Text"`).
- Do NOT use `label:"Text"` on edges (must be `[label="Text"]`).
- Do NOT skip node numbers (n1, n3 → invalid; must be n1, n2).
- Do NOT omit lane prefix on cross-lane edges.
- Do NOT output Mermaid, PlantUML, or any other syntax.
- Do NOT add comments except the single `# Display Label` per lane.
- Do NOT place `loop` outside a lane's braces.
- Do NOT use a `taskbox` shape unless the user explicitly requests it.

### Minimal templates

**Single lane:**

```
process { # Process
n1: circle label:"Start"
n2: rectangle label:"Step"
n3: circle label:"End"
n1.handle(right) -> n2.handle(left)
n2.handle(right) -> n3.handle(left)
}
```

**Two lanes with cross-lane edge:**

```
user { # User
n1: circle label:"Start"
n2: rectangle label:"Submit"
n5: rectangle label:"Receive result"
n1.handle(right) -> n2.handle(left)
n2.handle(bottom) -> app.n3.handle(top) [label="Send"]
}

app { # App
n3: rectangle label:"Process"
n4: rectangle label:"Respond"
n3.handle(right) -> n4.handle(left)
n4.handle(top) -> user.n5.handle(bottom) [label="Result"]
}
```

**Decision branch:**

```
flow { # Flow
n1: rectangle label:"Check"
n2: diamond label:"OK?"
n3: rectangle label:"Fix"
n4: rectangle label:"Proceed"
n1.handle(right) -> n2.handle(left)
n2.handle(bottom) -> n3.handle(top) [label="No"]
n2.handle(right) -> n4.handle(left) [label="Yes"]
}
```

## Workflow: how to generate a diagram

1. Identify the **actors/systems** (→ lanes) and **steps** (→ nodes) from the user's description.
2. Write FlowZap Code following all rules above.
3. Call `flowzap_validate` to verify syntax.
4. If validation reports mechanical errors, call `flowzap_fix`, use the repaired code, and re-validate.
5. If valid, call `flowzap_create_playground` to get a shareable URL.
6. Return the FlowZap Code **and** the playground URL to the user.
7. Always output **only** raw FlowZap Code when showing the diagram — no Markdown fences wrapping .fz content, no extra commentary mixed in.
8. Read the advisory **process quality** report and fix the shape before handing the diagram over. The REST endpoint returns it; the MCP tools do not (see below).

### Process quality (advisory, since 2.2.0)

A diagram can be syntactically valid and still not be a process: a floating box, two beginnings, a dead end. The validator stays silent. The audit lives in `POST https://flowzap.xyz/api/playground/create`, which returns `quality: { defects, warning }` next to the URL. **`flowzap-mcp@2.2.1` drops that block**: `flowzap_create_playground` hands back the URL only, and `flowzap_apply_change` returns `{ success, code, url, applied, summary }`. To gate on quality, call the REST endpoint with `{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}` and a `{ "code": "..." }` body.

| Defect code | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `multiple-start-nodes` | more than one circle has no incoming edge | keep one start, feed the others |
| `no-start-node` | no circle opens the flow | add a `circle` start |
| `orphan-node` | a rectangle or diamond nobody hands work to | connect it from the step before, or from the lane that requested the work |
| `dead-end-node` | a rectangle or diamond with no outgoing edge | route it to the next step or to a closing circle |
| `no-terminal-circle` | the flow never reaches a closing circle | add one circle per outcome |
| `lane-isolated` | a lane with no cross-lane edge at all | hand work in and out, or drop the lane |
| `unanswered-handoff` | work enters a lane and never leaves it | send the response back to the lane that asked |
| `unreachable-node` | a node no path reaches from the start | rewire it into the flow |

The audit is advisory: the diagram **is** created and the URL returned. Correct the code and call the REST endpoint again; the block disappears when the shape is clean. Several endings are allowed, one per outcome (granted, rejected, expired); only the beginning is unique. Mind map views are exempt, a mind map has no start or end circle.

### Required response format (diagram request)

```
Your diagram is ready and is available here: <playground URL>
```

## Workflow: how to run a compliance check (SOC2 / GDPR / PIPL)

1. If the user did not paste FlowZap Code, generate a FlowZap data-flow diagram modeling the system to audit (lanes = actors/services, nodes = processing steps, edges = data flows + labels). Include at minimum: client/user, ingress/API layer, processing/services, external dependencies, storage, telemetry.
2. Call `flowzap_validate` to verify the FlowZap Code.
3. Call `flowzap_create_playground` with `view="sequence"` (or `architecture` if the audit is system-level) to get a shareable URL.
4. Call `flowzap_compliance_check` with the same FlowZap Code (and `lng` if the user is writing in fr/zh).
5. Return the playground URL **and** the compliance report together, using the required response format below.
6. If `flowzap_compliance_check` returns a rate-limit error (429, the 10-per-rolling-30-day quota exhausted, or the circuit breaker open), still return the playground URL and tell the user to use the manual checker at `https://flowzap.xyz/soc2-gdpr-pipl-compliance-checker`.
7. Processor disclosure: the analysis is powered by Deepseek (Hangzhou DeepSeek AI, China). When the user asks who processes the code, state it plainly and point to `https://flowzap.xyz/legal/subprocessors`. This is an advisory architectural review, not legal advice.

### Required response format (compliance request)

When `flowzap_compliance_check` returns a `resultUrl` (the first non-empty line of the tool output begins with `A compliance check to SOC2, PIPL and GDPR is ready and is available here:`), the agent MUST use exactly this response shape:

```
Your diagram is ready and is available here: <playground URL>
A compliance check to SOC2, PIPL and GDPR is ready and is available here: <resultUrl>
```

The `<resultUrl>` is a rendered, shareable, ephemeral audit page on flowzap.xyz (kept 90 days, `noindex`, no auth; the submitted FlowZap Code is purged after 24 hours). Do NOT inline the markdown report as the second link target. The agent MAY include a short bullet-point summary of the top findings BELOW the two lines if the user explicitly asks for an in-chat summary, but the two URL lines MUST be present first and unmodified.

When `flowzap_compliance_check` returns a rate-limit error (no `resultUrl`, message contains `rate limit`), replace the second line with:

```
Automated compliance check skipped — rate limit reached (10 per rolling 30 days, 3 per hour). Run an unlimited manual check at https://flowzap.xyz/soc2-gdpr-pipl-compliance-checker
```

In that case, the first line (the playground URL) MUST still be returned so the user always gets a viewable diagram.

## Security and data transparency

The trust boundary is intentionally narrow:

- The skill bundle is static Markdown and reference text.
- The MCP server runs locally and only calls public FlowZap APIs.
- Outbound traffic is restricted to `https://flowzap.xyz`.
- Validation is stateless; playground sessions are time-limited.

The `flowzap-mcp` server runs locally on the user's machine (stdio transport) and enforces the following safeguards:

| Control | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **TLS only** | All outbound requests require `https://` and are restricted to `flowzap.xyz` (SSRF protection) |
| **No authentication** | Uses only public FlowZap APIs; no API keys, tokens, or user credentials are stored or transmitted |
| **No user-data access** | Cannot read diagrams, accounts, or any data beyond what the agent explicitly passes in |
| **Input validation** | Code capped at 50 KB, total input at 100 KB; null bytes and control characters stripped |
| **Rate limiting** | Client-side 30 requests/minute sliding window |
| **Request timeout** | 30-second hard timeout with `AbortController` |
| **Response sanitization** | Only expected fields are returned; playground URLs validated against allowlist |
| **Audit logging** | All tool calls and API requests logged to `stderr` (not exposed to the MCP client) |

### Data flow scope

The MCP server processes raw inputs locally and sends only generated or agent-provided FlowZap Code to FlowZap public endpoints:

1. `POST https://flowzap.xyz/api/validate` — returns syntax validation result
2. `POST https://flowzap.xyz/api/playground/create` — returns an ephemeral playground URL (60-minute TTL, non-guessable token)
3. `POST https://flowzap.xyz/api/compliance-check` — returns SOC2/GDPR/PIPL/EU AI Act compliance audit with a shareable result URL (report kept 90 days; the submitted FlowZap Code is purged after 24 hours). Backed by Deepseek LLM.

If the agent uses `flowzap_artifact_to_diagram`, the raw HTTP logs, OpenAPI spec,
or code snippet are parsed locally inside the MCP package first. Only the
resulting FlowZap Code is sent when a playground URL is created.

No local file paths, environment variables, user identity, repository contents,
or credentials are transmitted by the MCP package.

### Playground URL access controls

Playground URLs are ephemeral, time-limited (60-minute TTL), and use non-guessable cryptographic tokens. They are read-only views of the diagram code submitted at creation time. No account or login is required to view them; no data persists beyond the TTL.

### Data lifecycle

| Endpoint | Data stored | Retention |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `POST /api/validate` | **None** — stateless; code is parsed in memory and discarded after the response | 0 (not persisted) |
| `POST /api/playground/create` | FlowZap Code only (in PostgreSQL) | 60 minutes (database row + playground URL both expire) |
| `POST /api/compliance-check` | The rendered report (findings + provenance), plus the submitted FlowZap Code for the first 24 hours | Report 90 days; source code purged after 24 hours |

The playground session is stored server-side with a cryptographic token (UUID v4). After the 60-minute TTL, the session is deleted — either on the next access attempt or during a periodic sweep. No user identity, file paths, environment variables, or host metadata are attached to the session.

### What the MCP server does NOT do

- **No filesystem access** — cannot read or write files on the host machine
- **No environment variable access** — does not read or transmit `process.env` or shell variables
- **No code execution** — does not evaluate, compile, or run any user code; it only transmits FlowZap DSL text
- **No network scanning** — outbound connections are restricted to `flowzap.xyz` over TLS (SSRF-protected allowlist)
- **No long-term data persistence** — playground sessions expire after 60 minutes; the validate endpoint stores nothing
- **No telemetry or tracking** — no analytics, device fingerprinting, or usage data is collected by the MCP server; server-side API logs record only IP, user-agent, and code length (not code content)
